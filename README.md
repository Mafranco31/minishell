# Minishell

Minishell is an important project over the 42 common cursus where we have to create a simple shell.
It has been coded with [Dlitran]([readme.com](https://github.com/dlitran)).

# Description

Minishell should behave like bash, and the following built-in are implemented :
- cd
- export
- unset
- echo
- pwd
- exit

# Installation

```c
git clone https://github.com/Mafranco31/minishell.git
